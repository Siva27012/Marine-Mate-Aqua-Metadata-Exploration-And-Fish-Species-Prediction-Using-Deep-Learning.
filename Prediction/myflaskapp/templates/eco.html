                        Flower Shrimp (Atyopsis moluccensis) are freshwater shrimp originating from Southeast Asia. They are often referred to as Bamboo Shrimp due to their popularity in aquarium communities worldwide. These colorful shrimp can change hues rapidly, going from tan to brown to red. They have a distinctive racer stripe down their backs. These shrimp grow to about 3.5 inches in length, making them one of the larger freshwater shrimp species. A 20-gallon tank is recommended to provide ample space for their exploration and hiding. Flower Shrimp are peaceful and exhibit animated personalities.Besides Flower Shrimp, they go by various names, including Asian Filter Shrimp, Fan Shrimp, and Timber Shrimp.</p>

                        Rock Lobster, also known as Spiny Lobster, belongs to the family Palinuridae and encompasses approximately 60 species of achelate crustaceans found in warm oceans and seas worldwide. Despite the name, they are not true lobsters but are more closely related to spiny lobsters and furry lobsters. These fascinating creatures have enlarged antennae projecting forward from their heads as wide plates. They inhabit continental shelves at depths of up to 500 meters and feed on mollusks, crustaceans, polychaetes, and echinoderms. Slipper lobsters grow slowly, live to a considerable age, and lack giant neurons for tailflips, relying on other means to escape predators. </p>

In their most common forms, their shell colors vary from a deep, mottled green to very dark brown.These crabs are highly cannibalistic, especially during molting. Females can give birth to a million offspring, which can grow up to 3.5 kg in size and have a shell width up to 24 cm wide. </p>

The males are bright blue with white spots and long chelipeds, while females have a duller green/brown color and a more rounded carapace (up to 20 centimeters wide). These crabs stay buried under sand or mud most of the time, emerging during high tide to feed on various organisms such as bivalves, fish, and macroalgae. </p>

                        Cuttlefish, also known as cuttles, are marine molluscs belonging to the order Sepiida. They share the class Cephalopoda with squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. These fascinating creatures possess a distinctive internal shell called the cuttlebone, which they use for buoyancy control. With their large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles adorned with denticulated suckers, cuttlefish secure their prey. Their size typically ranges from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches), although the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama) can reach up to 50 cm (20 inches) in mantle length and weigh over 10.5 kg (23 lb). Cuttlefish exhibit remarkable intelligence and have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios among invertebrates. </p>

                        Squid, part of the order Teuthida, are fascinating cephalopods found in both coastal and oceanic waters. They possess elongated tubular bodies, short compact heads, and ten arms. Two of these arms transform into long, slender tentacles adorned with toothed, horny rings. Squid eyes, almost as complex as human eyes, are usually set into the sides of their heads. Luminescent squids bear numerous light organs, possibly for recognition and attracting prey. These creatures serve as food for various animals, including sperm whales, bony fishes, and humans. The giant squid and colossal squid are the largest living invertebrates, with some reaching lengths of nearly 13 meters (about 43 feet) or more. </p>

                        Oysters, a diverse group of salt-water bivalve molluscs, inhabit marine or brackish environments. Their irregularly shaped, highly calcified valves distinguish them. While not all oysters belong to the superfamily Ostreoidea, some are consumed as delicacies. Notably, pearl oysters yield pearls, and windowpane oysters are prized for their shells. The term “oyster” traces back to the Old French oistre, derived from the Latin ostrea, which in turn comes from the Ancient Greek ὄστρεον (ostreon) meaning “oyster”.</p>

                        Pearl oysters, a genus of saltwater oysters in the family Pteriidae, create a captivating inner shell layer called nacre, commonly known as “mother of pearl.” Unlike edible oysters (family Ostreidae) or freshwater pearl mussels (families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae), pearl oysters are distinct. Notably, Pinctada margaritifera and P. maxima are cultivated for South Sea and Tahitian pearls. These remarkable mollusks thrive in the central and eastern Indo-Pacific. On the reverse side of the 1,000-peso note in the Philippines, you can spot a pearl oyster. Various species within the genus produce pearls, each with unique sizes and colors. For instance, black South Sea pearls come from the black-lip oyster, while Akoya cultured pearls originate from the Akoya pearl oyster.  </p>

                        Hammerhead sharks, a group of sharks forming the family Sphyrnidae, are named for their distinctive and unusual heads. These heads are flattened and laterally extended into a cephalofoil, resembling a T-shape or a “hammer”. The shark’s eyes are positioned at either end of this T-shaped structure, with their small mouths centered and underneath. Most hammerhead species belong to the genus Sphyrna, while the winghead shark has its own genus, Eusphyra.Hammerheads are found worldwide, preferring warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, some hammerhead species form large schools during the day but become solitary hunters at night. Their known species range from approximately 0.9 to 6.0 meters (2 ft 11 in to 19 ft 8 in) in length and weigh between 3 to 580 kilograms (6.6 to 1,300 pounds). </p>

In Australia and New Zealand, they are commonly known as shovelnose rays or shovelnose sharks. Guitarfish have a unique body form intermediate between sharks and rays. Their triangular or guitar-like head shape sets them apart from other rays. These bottom feeders bury themselves in mud or sand, consuming worms, crabs, and clams. Some species can tolerate salt, fresh, and brackish water, and they often inhabit coastal areas and estuaries.  </p>

Members of this family have flattened pectoral fin discs, varying from oval to diamond-like shapes. Their common name stems from their whip-like tails, which are significantly longer than the disc and lack dorsal and caudal fins. Except for the porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), all whiptail stingrays possess one or more venomous stings near the base of their tails, used for defense. When stinging their victims, they jerk their tails, leaving the stinger in the wound </p>
