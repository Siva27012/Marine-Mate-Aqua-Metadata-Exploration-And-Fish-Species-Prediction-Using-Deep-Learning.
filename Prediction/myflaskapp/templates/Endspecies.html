It is the largest living member of the family Labridae and is uniquely adapted to freshwater habitats. Despite its rarity, it faces significant threats due to habitat degradation, pollution, and overfishing. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this remarkable aquatic species.</p>

                <p class="about__text">The humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), also known as the Napoleon wrasse or Māori wrasse, is a remarkable marine fish found primarily on coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. It is the largest living member of the family Labridae and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. Its distinctive features include thick lips, two black lines behind its eyes, and a prominent hump on the forehead of larger adults. Humphead wrasses are protogynous hermaphrodites, transitioning to males around 9 years old. They feed on invertebrates and play a vital role in reef ecosystems.</p>

This small and stocky gray shark grows not much longer than 1 meter (3.3 feet) and has a fairly long, pointed snout. Despite its scarcity, it plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique and enigmatic shark.</p>

It is endemic to Madagascar and the Indian Ocean. First described in 1801, this fish has a unique name that possibly reflects its origin. The Southern meagre’s habitat includes coastal waters and estuaries, where it plays an essential role in the marine ecosystem. </p></div>

It is the only herbivore among different turtle species. Contrary to its name, the green turtle’s shell color is not green; it is named after the greenish color of its cartilage and fat. In the Eastern Pacific, a subgroup of green turtles with darker shells is locally referred to as black turtles. These ancient mariners play a crucial role in maintaining the health of our oceans and seagrass habitats. Let’s continue to protect and appreciate these remarkable sea turtles!</p></div>

It closely resembles the Australian snubfin dolphin (of the same genus, Orcaella), which was not described as a separate species until 2005. Its color ranges from slate blue to slate gray. Although found in much of the riverine and marine zones of South and Southeast Asia, the only concentrated lagoon populations are found in Chilika Lake in Odisha, India, and Songkhla Lake in southern Thailand.</p> </div>
